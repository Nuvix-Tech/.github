# Nuvix

Welcome to **Nuvix**, a powerful and extensible Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform designed to simplify backend development. Built with **TypeScript**, **NestJS**, and a custom **database library**, Nuvix enables developers to create scalable applications with minimal effort.

- **Real-Time Communication** â€“ Integrated **Socket.IO** for real-time updates.
- **Job Queues & Scheduling** â€“ Powered by **BullMQ** for background tasks.
- **Webhooks & Event System** â€“ Efficient event-driven architecture.
- **Chunked File Uploads** â€“ Supports resumable uploads and optimized storage.
- **Push Notifications** â€“ Built-in support for **FCM**, **Twilio**, and external providers.
