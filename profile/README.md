# 🪐 Nuvix · Modern Backend Platform

**Nuvix** is a high-performance backend platform built for modern applications — fast, scalable, and developer-first.

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for Nuvix. This space hosts open tools, SDKs, and resources we share with the developer community. While Nuvix itself is a managed platform, we believe in transparency, modularity, and empowering developers with the right abstractions.

## ✨ What is Nuvix?

Nuvix provides a powerful backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform built on PostgreSQL with modern architecture, scalable primitives, and developer-first tooling.

We currently support:

🧩 Database – Powerful PostgreSQL engine with flexible schema control.

🔐 Auth – Built-in authentication with roles, sessions, and permissions.

✉️ Messaging – Unified APIs for email, SMS, and push notifications.

🗄️ Storage –  Modern file storage with support for image transformation.

Key Features:

⚙️ Three schema types – Document, Managed SQL, and Unmanaged SQL.

🧠 Custom query language – NuvQL for expressive, URL-safe filtering and querying.

🛡 Advanced access control – Table-level and Row-level security (TLS + RLS).

🔄 Postgres-to-REST API – With advanced embedding, joins, and filtering.

🧱 Multi-project isolation – Secure, scalable, and team-ready by design.

Nuvix is designed to help you move fast without compromising on control, security, or performance.
